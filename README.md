"Improved Harris hawks optimization based on adaptive cooperative foraging and dispersed foraging strategies"

This is a new framework based on Harris hawks optimization algorithm for numerical optimization problems.

We are further improving the readability of the code, and will provide it to the this platform as soon as possible.
